# Frontend

Our Frontend team focuses on giving users a nice looking design along with 
easy to use and interactive tools to help them in their homework endeavors
using vue.js, html, css, and javascript. 

## Design

Our Project is aiming for a modern looking design that relaxes users and is 
visually pleasing. Similar websites such as ours have very outdated designs
which is one thing that many students complain about because the old and
outdated designs make it hard to fully enjoy the content. Our goal is to
solve this by implementing a clean and modern looking interface that engages
users and helps them in their use and navigation of the website.

## UI/UX

Easy to use interface with many assisting features to help users 
navigate through the website. Our project hopes to offer ease of use for 
students to submit answers and finish assignments. We also want to make it
simple for students to check their assignments as well as their grades. For 
instructors, we want to allow more personalized input on assignments as well
as making it very easy to post create and post assignments, view class 
statistics, and view an individual's progress.

## Webpage

The webpage aims to be a one-stop solution for students, educators, and administrators alike. It combines essential elements like course materials, assignments, quizzes, and collaborative tools with an interactive and user-friendly interface. In addition, we incorporate search and filtering options to help users find relevant content quickly and effortlessly. We also integrate social sharing and community features, allowing users to interact, discuss, and collaborate with their peers, fostering a sense of community and collaborative learning.

## In App View

The in-app view focuses on delivering a seamless learning experience within the web app environment. Using the latest web technologies, we ensure smooth performance and an intuitive user interface tailored to the specific platform. The web app offers easy access to course materials, allowing users to continue learning with a simple internet connection.
