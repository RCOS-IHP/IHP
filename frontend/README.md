# Frontend

Our Frontend team focuses on giving users a nice looking design along with 
easy to use and interactive tools to help them in their homework endeavors
using vue.js, html, css, and javascript. 

## Design

Our Project is aiming for a modern looking design that relaxes users and is 
visually pleasing. Similar websites such as ours have very outdated designs
which is one thing that many students complain about because the old and
outdated designs make it hard to fully enjoy the content. Our goal is to
solve this by implementing a clean and modern looking interface that engages
users and helps them in their use and navigation of the website.

## UI/UX

Easy to use interface with many assisting features to help users 
navigate through the website. Our project hopes to offer ease of use for 
students to submit answers and finish assignments. We also want to make it
simple for students to check their assignments as well as their grades. For 
instructors, we want to allow more personalized input on assignments as well
as making it very easy to post create and post assignments, view class 
statistics, and view an individual's progress.
