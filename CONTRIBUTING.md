# Contributing

As IHP is a very new project, we are not currently accepting contributions from outside the IHP GitHub organization. 

Contributors who are members of IHP should create a branch within the IHP repo. 
Once the feature has been implemented or the bug has been fixed, a pull request should be made to merge the branch into main.
All branches should be related to an issue, and pull requests should generally address/close the issue.
