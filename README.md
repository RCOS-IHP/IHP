# IHP
An open source homework tool for professors and students similar to Pearson Mastering, which gives professors more control over what questions are being presented. A more modernized UI with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, students can answer questions, check their grades, and submit feedback to their professors.

## Usage

Run IHP with `docker compose up`. When first installed and after any changes, you will need to first run `docker compose build`.
Backend tests can be run using the commands `pipenv sync --dev` and then `pipenv test` from the backend directory.
