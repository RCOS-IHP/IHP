# IHP
An open source homework tool for professors and students similar to Pearson Mastering, which gives professors more control over what questions are being presented. A more modernized UI with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, students can answer questions, check their grades, and submit feedback to their professors.

## Usage

Use `npm run dev` from the frontend folder to run the frontend for development.

From the backend folder, use `pipenv run dev` to run the api, and `pipenv run test` to run the Pytest tests.
